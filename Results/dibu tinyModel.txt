    the hero of all Argentina. Can you sum up your feelings after that tonight?

D:
    So, 3G game, I thought we controlled the game really well. We went to no lap, basically we controlled the game, the referee for just giving everything for them. All of the side in the good header, good flick, which I couldn't see here. And then it turns upside down, the referee for giving everything for them, he gave 10 minutes. For no reason, 10 minutes, it was game 3K outside the box for them like 2-3 times. He just wanted them to score that, that's basically it. So, hopefully we don't have that referee anymore, he's useless.

I:
    Okay, but when you got to the pound tissue to out, what's the thinking going into the spot case in the capital?

D:
    I hope that Bangalore is saying we're going to advantage if we go to the penalties win, I think he needs to keep his mouth shut.

I:
    going forward now, Croatia and semi-finals. A few minutes about that.

D:
    It's a tough game, every single game is tough, so we enjoy today and they will see tomorrow.
