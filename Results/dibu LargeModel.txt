I:
    the hero of all Argentina. Can you sum up your feelings after that tonight?

D:
    It was a tricky game and I thought we controlled the game really well. We went 2-0 up, basically we controlled the game. The ref was just giving everything for them. All of a sudden they get a good header, a good flick, which I couldn't see. And then it just turned upside down. The ref was giving everything for them. He gave 10 minutes. For no reason 10 minutes. He was giving free kicks outside the box for them like two, three times. He just wanted them to score that. That's basically it. So hopefully we don't have that ref anymore. He's useless.

I:
    Okay, but when you got to the penalty shootout, what's the thinking going into the spot kicks?

D:
    I heard Van Gaal saying we got an advantage in penalties, if we go to penalties we win. I think he needs to keep his mouth shut.

I:
    Going forward now, Croatia in the semi-finals. How do you feel about that?

D:
    It's a tough game, every single game is tough. We enjoyed today and we'll see tomorrow.
